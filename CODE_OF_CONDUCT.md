# Be Nice(r)!

1. **Bring the best, and most adorable, version of yourselves.**

   We encourage everyone to bring out the most respectful, positive, and
   helpful version of themselves.

2. **Everyone is welcome!**

   Everyone is welcome to contribute, so make sure everyone feels welcome.

   * **Nurture new contributors.** Help them learn the codebase and processes,
     fill in gaps when needed, thank them for their contribution, and make
     them feel welcome and valued.
     This goes double for design and documentation contributors!
   * **Support coders.** Without code, there is no project. Contributors
     who take the time to write and maintain code are key to the project’s
     success. Offer assistance and recognition wherever possible.

3. **People are different...**

   Expect to interact with people different from you—whether in worldview,
   politics, religion, identity, or background. You do not have to agree with them,
   but you are _expected_ to behave respectfully and make them feel welcome.

4. **Do not “punch down.”**

   We will not tolerate sexism, racism, homophobia, or any other indecorous or boorish behavior.
   Such behavior is not adorable (see #1).

5. **Be the hero!**

    If you see something, say something, ..and do something.
    Stand up for someone else - especially if they're different from you.

6. **Everyone has good and bad days.**

   We expect that you take a break rather than let your bad
   day affect everyone else. We might suggest that you take a break if you forget.

   * People who continually drain the joy from the group may be asked to leave.
   * People who continually increases the joy of the group may be nominated
     to leadership positions.
