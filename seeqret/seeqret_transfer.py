    """seeqret export <user>

       Exports secrets from a SQLite database, preparing them for secure
       transfer to the specified receiver. The function retrieves secrets,
       decrypts them with a symmetric key, then encrypts the values with
       asymmetric encryption for the receiver. Finally, it generates a
       signature for the exported secrets for authenticity and integrity.

       Parameters:
           to (str): The recipient's username or the string 'self'
                     indicating the administrator. Secrets will be encrypted
                     using the public key of the specified user or
                     administrator.

       Returns:
           dict: A dictionary structured to contain metadata of the transaction
                 including the sender, receiver, and encrypted secrets ready
                 for transfer, along with a signature.

       Raises:
           Various exceptions may arise during database connection issues,
           encryption/decryption processes, or key-loading operations,
           depending on implementation details not shown here.
