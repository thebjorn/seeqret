The code in the `filecrypt.py` file is from [Asymetric Encryption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd5nsMscPo0) which is well worth watching...

The code in `pgp_filecrypt.py` contains the code needed to do pgp encryption/decryption (here you need to set the trust level when importing keys to the people you want to send encrypted messages to).
